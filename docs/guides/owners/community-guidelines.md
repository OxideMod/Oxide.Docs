# Community Guidelines

The guidelines below are meant to serve as the basis to create and maintain a healthy Oxide community. Please consider them carefully when participating in our community spaces, forums, and Discord.

## Core Principles

### Civilized Discussion
Please be polite and treat everyone here with respect. Like a public park, this community is a shared resource.

**What is respect to us?**
- Assume others know something you do not.
- Pursue what is meaningful and assume others are too.
- Be precise in your language.
- Tell the truth, or at least do not lie.

### Make it Better
Improve the discussion, even if only in a small way. Help us make this a healthy and safe place for discussion.

### Agreeability, Politeness, and Compassion
Even in a disagreement, be polite. Losing an argument is not a bad thing as we learn something from the effort.

Remember that many contributors are volunteering their time for little or nothing in return.

### Participation Counts
Conversations had here may be read dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of times. Helping one person may help many others after.

Take care to set a tone that will positively influence the future of this community.

## Community Conduct

### Report Problems
Our team of moderators rely heavily on the community to report abusive or bad behavior.

Do not engage with abuse or trolling, just report it and move on. Abusive people and trolls are encouraged by acknowledgement, do not give them the satisfaction.

### Be Civil
- Do not post anything that a reasonable person may consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
- Do not post obscene or sexually explicit content.
- Do not harass, grief, impersonate, or dox people.
- Do not spam.

This is a public place. Everything said here may be stored forever, if not by us then by third-party search engines and robots.

### Off-site Behavior
Outside of Oxide sites, and on social media in general, we ask you not to behave in such a way that would reflect poorly on our community. Users who are found to be participating in toxic or illegal behavior on other sites may find themselves unable to use Oxide resources.

### Keep it Tidy
Please try to post things in the correct place.

- Do not start a thread in the wrong category.
- Do not cross-post the same thing in multiple threads or categories.
- Do not post empty replies.
- Stay on topic, new topics in a new thread.

### Be Original
Do not post anything that belongs to someone else without permission. Do not post descriptions, links, or methods for stealing someone else's work or breaking the law.

## Enforcement

The Oxide team reserves the right to remove content or ban users who violate these guidelines. Our goal is to maintain a healthy, productive community where everyone feels welcome to participate.

When a user violates the community guidelines, moderators may take actions such as:
- Warning the user
- Temporarily suspending the user
- Permanently banning the user in cases of severe or repeated violations
- Removing offending content

## Reporting Guidelines Violations

If you notice content that violates these guidelines, please report it to the moderators using the appropriate channels:
- Use the report function on the forums
- Contact moderators via private message
- Email the support team

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, you help create a positive environment that benefits everyone in the Oxide community. Remember that we're all here to learn, share knowledge, and improve our game servers together.
