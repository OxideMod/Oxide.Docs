# Does not rely on deprecated functionality

1. Upcoming or existing deprecations will necessitate fundamental changes, refactoring, and/or universalization (with preprocessor directives). 
2. Plugin should utilize the most up-to-date game-agnostic API.

## Explanation

This guideline requires that plugins do not utilise any deprecated functionality with other plugins or APIs, and should not make use of deprecated hooks or hooks/functionality that is likely or confirmed to be removed in the future.
