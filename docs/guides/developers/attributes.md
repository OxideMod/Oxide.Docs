Custom commands are easily implemented with minimal boilerplate for both in-game chat interfaces and conventional command-line interfaces.
## Chat commands
Chat commands are in-game commands entered via the game client's chat, prefixed by a forward slash (/).

when using covalence
```csharp
[Command("test")]
private void TestCommand(IPlayer player, string command, string[] args)
{
    player.Reply("Test successful!");
}
```
when using Rustplugin
```csharp
[ChatCommand("test")]
void cmdTest (BasePlayer player, string command, string [] args)
{
	Puts("Test successful!");
}
```
## Console commands
Console commands may be executed from the server console and in-game interfaces F1 (where applicable).

when using covalence
```csharp
[Command("test")]
private void TestCommand(IPlayer player, string command, string[] args)
{
    player.Reply("Test successful!");
}
```
when using Rustplugin
```csharp
[ConsoleCommand("test")]
private void cmdTest((ConsoleSystem.Arg arg))
{
    Puts("Test successful!");
}
```
## Command permissions
Easily restrict command usage to players who have a permission assigned to them.
